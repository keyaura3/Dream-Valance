# Statistical Analysis on Dream Valence Using Sentiment Analysis Package VADER

## Absract 

Dreams are essential to our overall health and well-being. In particular, negative dreams experienced during the REM stage of sleep can have serious mental and physical repercussions. Here, we present a unique approach to analyzing dream data through textual data and analysis. The first portion of our analysis focused on exploring the data and applying VADER to our data set. Utilizing the Autoregressive (AR), Moving Averages (MA), and the combined ARMA models, we attempt, with mixed results, to predict the subsequent compound score of randomly selected individuals.

## Introduction

While the importance of sleep for overall health has been well-established, the significance of dreams is often overlooked. Research has shown that dreams foster creativity and problem-solving, process emotions to reduce anxiety, and solidify long-term memories [4]. Dreaming occurs during the rapid eye movement (REM) stage of sleep, which is when the body repairs physical health by increasing blood flow to the brain, regulating our growth hormones, and nourishing metabolic and immune functions [5]. Notably, the occurrence of bad dreams, specifically recurring nightmares, is linked to heightened anxiety and increased avoidance of REM sleep in the following days [6]. This severe REM sleep deprivation is heavily correlated with mental disorder development [4]. Therefore, it is crucial to study both positive and negative dream experiences to promote better health and well-being.

In this paper, we analyze the dream diaries of 94 individuals across the 1940s to 2000s. Specifically, we identified and investigated the valence scores of dream entries using the VADER library, tested the relationship between the sentiment scores and the individual dreamers, and utilized a statistical analysis model to predict future dream sentiment. On the granular level, we scrutinized certain dreamers to identify recurring themes. This paper aims to identify patterns and predict future valence scores of dreams to uncover underlying causes and hopefully mitigate the occurrence of negative dreams.
