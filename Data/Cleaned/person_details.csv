William Domhoff's book The Scientific Study of Dreams (2003); (3) the series is so extensive that it is extremely useful for studying subsets on specific issues (e.g., how she interacts with her ex-husband Howard, or how she reacted to an infatuation with Derek, or how she conceives of each of her three siblings and three children, or how she conceives of cats and dogs, or what happens when she is on or near bridges).For the ""cast of characters"" in Barb Sanders' dreams, click here.The full text of our interviews with her (in PDF format) is available here, and our detailed analysis of Barb Sanders' dream series -- our best case-study to date -- is here.",female,1,1960-1997,3116
