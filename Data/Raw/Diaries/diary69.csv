We enjoyed studying together, and we were not distracted by our nude bodies being pressed together. We shifted to a different position after a little while, and I was lying with my legs against her right leg. My chest rested against her back, and I had my arm about her midriff.

Then it began to go down, but it immediately began swelling again. Someone gave me a bag of food, and I ate some. The shop workers were leaving the ward. I decided to stay on the ward because I was to be discharged in a few days and because of the boil on my hand. But after they left, I decided to go. I had difficulty because I did not know the way. I knew it was near ward 9 or 11. I told some patients about my difficulty and asked if they could help.

I boarded a bus a day or so after that, and two teenage boys were sitting behind me, and joked with each other about how my hair was cut. This may be related to my present attempts at self-analysis.) Later I was unable to walk for some reason, and a man who reminds me of someone I knew in the hospital named Goodhand or someone I knew in 1949 in a hospital, had to push me onto a stretcher.

A man came in, and tried to put the sides on a headboard so he could take it away. But the boards kept moving, and he could not attach them, so he decided not to take it. I reflected that the boards had seemed to be alive when the man tried to attach them. Then my sister came into the room with a large bandage covering her back. My mother came and we told her that my sister would have to leave the bandage on a few weeks. There was a cotton cloth taped over the bandage, and my sister peeled it off, leaving the bandage exposed.
